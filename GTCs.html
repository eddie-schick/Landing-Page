Prohibited Advertisements.</strong> SHAED, in its sole discretion, may prohibit Portal Participant or require Portal Participant to refrain from advertising any Products or providing any Product Content if SHAED has reason to believe that the advertisement, the sale or the Products violate Laws or any provision of the Portal Access Agreement. In addition, SHAED may remove Portal Participant’s advertisements in the Portal in its sole discretion, in response to notices of alleged copyright infringement or trademark misappropriation, or allegations of any other breach of a Third Party’s Intellectual Property Rights. If SHAED requests that Portal Participant remove advertisements for Products or Product Content from the Portal, Portal Participant will make commercially reasonable efforts to remove the advertisements or Product Content within one Business Day of such request so that the advertisements and related Product Content no longer appear on the Portal.
